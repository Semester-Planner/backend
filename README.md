# The Semester Planner

Targeting CODE students, the Semester Planner aims to help students manage their time regarding the requirements for the modules they set out to pass that semester and avoid failing for reasons like forgetting about scheduling a mandatory check-in on time or submitting a topic proposal. The Express web app, in connection with our PostgreSQL relational database allows students to visualize all their requirements for an overview of the semester. Once a user adds their modules, the respective requirements are automatically present on one timeline where they can then set their own due dates and take notes within these tasks (called Entries). With the use of Google OAuth and passportJS, students can conveniently log in with their code.berlin email addresses without the need to sign up.
